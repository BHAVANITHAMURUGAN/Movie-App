# Movie-App
The movie app is a web application that allows users to browse and search for movies, view movie details, and view their IMDb ratings. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and uses a third-party API to retrieve movie data. This movie app uses the moviedb.org API to show a list of recent movies.
